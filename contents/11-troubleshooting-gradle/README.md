## Publish and share Build Scan

- understand build results, improve build performance, and collaborate to fix problems faster
- uploads Gradle metadata only, no source code

`./gradlew build --scan`
- accept terms and get the link to the scan. Eg.: https://gradle.com/s/5u4w3gxeurtd2

- you can delete the Build Scan when you are finished
- scan that has not been viewed within 3 months of being created will be removed. Once a Build Scan has been viewed, it will be available indefinitely
